This is an example of an LTL translation to structured NL:
X ! e & X f means "In the next moment of the system execution , e should not hold and , in the next moment of the system execution , f has to hold."

Please show how you would reason to get to a translation of what this LTL formula means:
[INPUT_FORMULA]

I am more interested in understanding how to read it rather than reaching the correct answer. Do so in a concise way, following this structure:
- Write down original LTL formula
- Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown).
- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity.
