"1","A",1,"",1,"",2,4,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"","F","Visual could be useful at least for explaining the temporal operators ","In a similar way to a flow chart, to think through what occurs when and what impacts what","My biggest source of confusion is whether F would be separate for each instance. If the condition is triggered multiple times, would a single F that could satisfy the condition satisfy the condition multiple times? "
"2","B",1,"",1,"",3,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"","F","They were just right. ","To figure out the logic behind loops.","No"
"3","C",1,"",1,"",2,4,1,NA,1,1,NA,NA,"","G","I needed perdonally more step-by-step breakdowns and maybe another example.","To be honest I'm not really sure. I thin it could be useful in terms of making softwares that need to have definitive stop and cut off points especially with the Until temporal operator.","I think adding an example that sort of mimics the style of the quiz could've been helpful! I feel like during the lecture I wasn't really thinking in a way that considered the sequences part and it took sometime for me to think back to the slides and try to apply the same level of thinking."
"4","D",1,"",1,"",2,3,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,"","U","Shorter and more visual. ","Some sort of sequential game. ",""
"5","E",1,"",1,"",2,2,NA,1,1,NA,NA,NA,"","G","I thought the explanations were fine! But I think they overcomplicated things at times by overexplaining.","For anything that changes states or time, or that has states that depend on each others values, or anything timed!",""
"6","F",1,"",1,"",2,4,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,"","G","more examples","understand how. the real world technology works using LTL",""
"7","G",1,"",1,"",2,3,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,"understanding what the question was asking sometimes. Or applying the formula to examples.","U","Maybe put an example where it satisfies after the explanation, or tailor the explanation to an example and show why it satisfies or fails (colors would help sort through the line of T's and F's)","If I wanted to make something true the entire time, as sort of a start/stop button, I could use G, or if I didn't really care when something happened, but it had to happen eventually, I'd use F. Like if I wanted a bad guy to pop out in a video game room after somebody walked in, but I didn't need it to be exactly the next moment, I'd use F. ","Maybe after learning the basics with T/F, using a more ""sentence"" like example, like how with propositional logic we began with truth tables and then moved on to using sentences as the propositions."
"8","H",1,"",1,"",3,3,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,"","U","I think the step by step was very helpful, but visuals would have really helped as well.","Maybe when the project involves run time being dependent on many variables/aspects."," "
"9","I",1,"",1,"",2,4,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,"","U","Same breakdown works really well","I could use it when trying to pseudocode for automazations ",""
"10","J",1,"",1,"",2,2,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,"","G","longer, more step by step for implication","For like autonomous cars softwares for immediate actions like braking?","This is cool and I hope we can learn more. It seems very useful and applicable"
"11","K",1,"",1,"",2,4,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,"","U","I thought they were good as is","Maybe in a game or some other continuous or looping project that requires repeated user input and other threads happening at the same time to allow other events to happen while the user is playing in the game depending on timestamps. ",""
"12","L",1,"",1,"",2,5,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,"","U","more visual ","by simplifying the logic behind some algorithms","Maybe we need to try writing out the sequence while learning "
"13","M",1,"",2,"I asked the teacher (Pablo) for help a few times. I assume he's the one reading this (hi) but maybe not?",3,3,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","U","I thought they were good","It could be good for handling various related parts of games or simulations",""
"14","N",1,"",1,"",2,3,1,NA,1,1,NA,NA,"","X","More [real life] examples.","For anything with time-based logic, for example with something interactive to model what could happen if something had to happen before something else to happen. ",""
"15","O",1,"",1,"",2,3,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,"","F","The explanations were pretty good. I wouldn't change anything.","I would use if I needed to build a form of machine in my engineering class whose behavior depended on whether certain properties are met.","Thanks Pablo and Sonora:)) This was fun and challenging"
"16","P",2,"Systems simmilar to LTL are used in video game programming. I am currently working as a programmer at a game studio so I see this type of stuff a lot.",2,"I asked Pablo questions about the phrasing of questions. I also used the cheat sheet we were given at the start of class. Finally, I used a piece of paper to put things in terms I understood better and to test edge cases.",3,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,"I found the wording of the questions like ""if variable a is always true, is the statement is invalidated"" since there are cases where that might be true and cases where that might be false. It would be nice if it was rephrased to something like ""statement is ALWAYS invalidated"".","F","More visual examples and examples of this in the real world instead of just examples using true and false.","I already do :) It is super useful in video game programming",""
"17","Q",1,"",1,"",2,4,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,"","U","I would make the explanations shorter.","I'm not sure",""
