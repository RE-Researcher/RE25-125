"1","A","No. a must be false and therefore !a be true from when the formula takes hold, which in this case is from the beginning of the sequence.

"3","C","Since it has an ! in front of a we can assume that the formula should start of as false instead of true","a: F F F F T T T","Yes since it accuretly explains the F temporal property when there is an explanation point in front of the variable.

","p: F F F F F T u: T T T F T T","Yes, this is correct since it clarifies how either m or q can always be false.

","a: F F F F F (False all throughout the given time)...","Yes, because it accurately breaks down and rephrases the explanation.

It is correct but could be misleading; ""eventually"" is a better way to refer to it! Thats just my opinion. Same with referring to it as ""at least once"". ","Yes.

"6","F","No, because G means that the formula must always be true, but we have that it is true in the beginning and then false from now on, therefore, a will be switched but the inconsistency is still present","a: F F F F F F F F F F F","No, because at some point in the future doesn't imply at least once during the execution","Yes, because G means tha it should always be true so whenever p does not hold, s must hold in the next step","G(c⇒X G r)  So if c holds, then starting from the next moment r should always hold, and this should always hold all together","F(!p & !u) - means that at some point in the future both p and u should not hold","p: T T T T T T F F T u: T T T T T T F T F ","Yes, because the formula means that G(!q) or G(!m) must be true to be true in general","Either q is always false or m is always false","No, because a should always be false, not whenever ","","(if a doesn't hold than z must hold eventually in the future) is always holds","a: FFFFFFFF z: FFFFFFTF","G(a⇒F(vUw))   It must always be true that if a holds then at some point in time v holds until w","a: TTTTTTTT v: FFTTTTFFF w: FFFFFFTTT"
"7","G","No, because in the beginning, a was true, but it must be false throughout the entire time in order to satisfy the formula","F F F","Yes. Because F(variable) means that it must be true at least once, and because it's F(!e), that means that at some point, at least one time, e must not be true in order to satisfy the formula, which what the explanation said.","Yes. Because the global operator is outside, so it's acting on everything inside. The inside says !p -> Xs, which means that if p doesn't hold, if p is false, then in the next moment s must be true. If p is true, it says nothing. ","It is always true that, if c holds, starting the next moment and continuing forever, r holds.","It is true that, for at least one time in the future, both p and u are false at the same time.","P: T F T F U: F F T T","Yes. Because the or operator is the ""highest"", and then the G operator, so either one variable in G, either !q or !m, always holds, or both always hold. Which is the same as their refined phrasing. But I would put the ""or"" operator first on the breakdown and not last. ","either, q is always false, or m is always false, or q and m are both always false.

"8","H","No, because the formula states that it must always be true that 'a' is false. This sequence shows that 'a' is true at some points, therefore, violating the formula.","a: F F F (false from now on)","Yes, because the formula's highest operation is F, meaning the sequence at some point must have 'e' be false.","Yes, because the breakdown is by highest operation and the phrasing is true.","It must be true that whenever c holds, in the next step, r must hold true and will hold true for the rest of the sequence.","At one point in the sequence, p and u must be false.","p: f t f t t f t t f ... u: t t t t t f t f t ...","yes, because it breaks down each operation by highest to lowest.","In the sequence, either q must always be false or m must always be false.","yes, because the implication must always hold, which only matters when a is false.","","When in the sequence 'a' is false, 'z' must eventually be true at some point.","a: f f f f f t t f ... z: f f f t f f t f ...","It must always be true that when a is true, v must eventually always be true until w is true.","a: f f f t f f t f f ... v: t f t f f f t t f ... w: f f t f t f t f t ..."
"9","I","This does not satisfy the formula because the G means that !a must always hold.","a:  F F F F F F F F F F","Yes, I think its correct because it specifies the time (not now) and how it is expressed in simpler terms through breaking down and rebuilding the concepts.","Yes, it uses break down and reconstruction appropriately and builds from the outside in.
